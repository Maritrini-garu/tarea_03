# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

## Objective 

- Based on a dataset with 79 variables predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, predict the value of the SalePrice variable. 

## Data

- The data used in this project is from  [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques]
- This version of the dataset was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
- These are the tables that comprise the Open Dataset:

    + `train.csv`: the training set
    + `test.csv`:  the test set
    + `data_description.txt`:  full description of each column, originally prepared by Dean De Cock but lightly edited to match the column names used here
    + `sample_submission.csv`: a benchmark submission from a linear regression on year and month of sale, lot square footage, and number of bedrooms


## Steps

- `load_data.py`: Extract the training and test dataset from csv
- `get_eda.py`: Do an exploratory data analysis for the dataset
- `data_prearation.py`:  Fill null values, and drop columns 
- `data_preprocessing.py`: Encode categorical values and feature engineering
- `train_model.py`: Train the model, obtain score and model prediction 
  

## Repository structure

`house-prices-data`: File containing the data description txt, test csv, and  the train csv.
`Modules`: All the modules used for the script functionality 
`Results`: File cointaining the output of the model with the predicted prices. 

## Data Model
 
The data model for this project is explained in the following diagram.
